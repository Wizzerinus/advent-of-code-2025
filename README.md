# AoC 2025

## What?

Advent of Code 2025, but every task must be done in a new programming language.

## Why?

I wanted to see how well I can switch between different programming languages :)

## How?

I only picked languages with which it's possible to do string manipulation effectively, so no Assembly this year. The languages which I believe have higher expressiveness are closer to the end of this list.

- Day 1: C
- Day 2: Shell
- Day 3: PHP
- Day 4: Javascript
- Day 5: Java
- Day 6: Python
- Day 7: Go
- Day 8: C++
- Day 9: Haskell
- Day 10: Rust
- Day 11: Free space!
- Day 12: Free space!

## Others

- I planned to use Lama for one of the problems, but it turned out that its implementation of Ostap is way too slow to use it, even with having memorization everywhere. Replaced it with C.
- I planned to use Typescript for one of the problems, but decided it was too similar to Javascript for such small tasks and replaced it with a free space instead.
- I planned to use Cangjie for one of the problems, but couldn't get its compiler to work on my machine in time, and replaced it with a free space as well.
- Maybe there will be Lisp next year :P
