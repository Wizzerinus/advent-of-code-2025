# AoC 2025

## What?

Advent of Code 2025, but every task must be done in a new programming language.

## Why?

I wanted to see how well I can switch between different programming languages :)

## How?

I only picked languages with which it's possible to do string manipulation effectively, so no Assembly this year. The languages which I believe have higher expressiveness are closer to the end of this list.

- Day 1: C
- Day 2: Shell
- Day 3: PHP
- Day 4: Javascript
- Day 5: Java
- Day 6: Python
- Day 7: Cangjie
  - I do not know anything about this language except that I need to get its compiler for my thesis. This is going to be fun.
- Day 8: Go
- Day 9: Haskell
- Day 10: C++
- Day 11: Rust
- Day 12: Free space!

_Note: originally Typescript was on this list, but I decided it was too similar to Javascript for such small tasks and replaced it with a free space instead._

## Others

- I planned to use Lama for one of the problems, but it turned out that its implementation of Ostap is way too slow to use it, even with having memorization everywhere.
- Maybe there will be Lisp next year :P
